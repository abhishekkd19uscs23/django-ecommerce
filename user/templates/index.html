        <ul>
            <li>Logarithmic<br>
                The complexity is proportional to the binary logarithm (i.e to the base 2) of <code><var>n</var></code>.<br>
                An example of a logarithmic sorting algorithm is Quick sort, with space and time complexity O<code>(n Ã— log n)</code>.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>Quadratic<br>
                The complexity is proportional to the square of <code><var>n</var></code>.<br>
                An example of a quadratic sorting algorithm is Bubble sort, with a time complexity of O<code>(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>.<br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Space and time complexity can also be further subdivided into 3 different cases: best case, average case and worst case.

            Sorting algorithms can be difficult to understand and it's easy to get confused.
            We believe visualizing sorting algorithms can be a great way to better understand their functioning while having fun!
